# Faculty's website

## 1. Introduction

This project aims at creating a website for a faculty member at a College setting. A number of tools to help with the delivery of courses will be included such as: a template to create presentation slides, a tool to allow students and/or groups of students to pick meeting timeslots, and a timetable for the faculty to display its availability to students.

## 5. Risks, Assumptions, and Constraints

### 5.1 Risks

- Any issues with hosting and domain that can interfere with the website accessibility will be solely the responsibility of the faculty
- Some of the contracted services can have sudden price hikes
- The faculty can inadvertently make changes that will cause the system to become unaccessible/unreliable
- Students might find it har to navigate a new system outside of the ones already offered by the college (Blackboard)

### 5.2 Assumptions

- The faculty is well versed in all technologies required to create and maintain the website
- The contracted services for hosting and domain are extremely reliable (accessible for more than 99.9% of the time)

### 5.3 Constraints

- No personal information will be stored (and/or displayed) in the website besides students names and emails
- No information regarding grades will be stored (and/or displayed) in the website
